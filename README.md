# Simple Animator

A side project to learn Processing framework and animation

Currently moving the shapes with the numpad keys, 8 is up 6 is right, etc... no longer using wasd

Note to self, looks like Processing really doesn't work well with folders... Need to figure out how to add more complicated structures for organization.
